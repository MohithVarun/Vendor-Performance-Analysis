## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Insights
The analysis highlights vendor dependency risks, slow-moving inventory, and cost variations caused by purchasing patterns. These insights can help improve pricing strategies, inventory planning, and vendor management.

## Conclusion
